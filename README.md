# Sprint 7 project 7

This project's aim was to test skills of working with JavaScript and write api tests for GET. POST, PUT and DELETE requests.

To accomplish the project several technologies and techniques were used: Git, GitHub, Postman, apiDocs, chat GPT, Jest and Node JS.
Chat GPT was used Only In cases where a mistake, an error or a failed test could not be understood by one who did the project.
Node JS and jest were used for testing the API requests, while Postman and apiDocs for ensuring the right URL endpoint and API's usage.

# Instructions on how to run the tests
